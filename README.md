mineConics
==========

This is just a simple webapp to draw aliased conics (circles, ellipses,
probably not hyperbolas) to be used as a guide in creating shapes in
[Minecraft](Http://minecraft.net).  mineConics uses canvas to draw the graphs
and a little bit of jquery move everything along smoothly.
